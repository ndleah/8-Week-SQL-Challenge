## 🛠️ Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## 📂 Dataset
Danny has shared with you 6 key datasets for this case study:

### **```runners```**

### **```runner_orders```**

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.



|order_id|runner_id|pickup_time|distance  |duration|cancellation      |

## ♻️ Data Preprocessing

### **Data Issues**

Data issues in the existing schema include:

* **```customer_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
* **```runner_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
  - units manually entered in ```distance``` and ```duration``` columns

### **Data Cleaning**

**```customer_orders```**
- Converting ```null``` and ```NaN``` values into blanks ```''``` in ```exclusions``` and ```extras```
  - Blanks indicate that the customer requested no extras/exclusions for the pizza, whereas ```null``` values would be ambiguous.
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table
  - We want to avoid permanently changing the raw data via ```UPDATE``` commands if possible.

**```runner_orders```**

- Converting ```'null'``` text values into null values for ```pickup_time```, ```distance``` and ```duration```
- Extracting only numbers and decimal spaces for the distance and duration columns
  - Use regular expressions and ```NULLIF``` to convert non-numeric entries to null values
- Converting blanks, ```'null'``` and ```NaN``` into null values for cancellation
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table

    co.order_time,
    ro.pickup_time,
    (pickup_time - order_time) AS time_to_pickup
  FROM updated_runner_orders AS ro
  INNER JOIN updated_customer_orders AS co
    ON ro.order_id = co.order_id
)
SELECT 
  runner_id,
  date_part('minutes', AVG(time_to_pickup)) AS avg_arrival_minutes
FROM runner_pickups
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```
| runner_id | avg_arrival_minutes |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | -4                  |
| 2         | 23                  |
| 3         | 10                  |

### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
```SQL
WITH order_count AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    order_time,
    COUNT(pizza_id) AS pizzas_order_count
  FROM updated_customer_orders
  GROUP BY order_id, order_time
), 
prepare_time AS (
  SELECT
    ro.order_id,
    co.order_time,
    ro.pickup_time,
    co.pizzas_order_count,
    (pickup_time - order_time) AS time_to_pickup
  FROM updated_runner_orders AS ro
  INNER JOIN order_count AS co
    ON ro.order_id = co.order_id
  WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  pizzas_order_count,
  AVG(time_to_pickup) AS avg_time
FROM prepare_time
GROUP BY pizzas_order_count
ORDER BY pizzas_order_count;
```

| pizzas_order_count | avg_time        |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1                  | 12              |
| 2                  | -6              |
| 3                  | 29              |

### **Q4. What was the average distance travelled for each runner?**
```SQL
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(AVG(distance), 2) AS avg_distance
FROM updated_runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

| runner_id | avg_distance |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1         | 15.85        |
| 2         | 23.93        |
| 3         | 10.00        |

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
SELECT
  MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS difference
FROM updated_runner_orders;
```

| difference |
|------------|
| 30         |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
WITH order_count AS (
  SELECT
    order_id,
    order_time,
    COUNT(pizza_id) AS pizzas_count
  FROM updated_customer_orders
  GROUP BY 
    order_id, 
    order_time
)
  SELECT
    ro.order_id,
    ro.runner_id,
    co.pizzas_count,
    ro.distance,
    ro.duration,
    ROUND(60 * ro.distance / ro.duration, 2) AS speed
  FROM updated_runner_orders AS ro
  INNER JOIN order_count AS co
    ON ro.order_id = co.order_id
  WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY speed DESC
```

| order_id | runner_id | pizzas_count | distance | duration | speed |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| 8        | 2         | 1            | 23.4     | 15       | 93.60 |
| 7        | 2         | 1            | 25       | 25       | 60.00 |
| 10       | 1         | 2            | 10       | 10       | 60.00 |
| 2        | 1         | 1            | 20       | 27       | 44.44 |
| 3        | 1         | 2            | 13.4     | 20       | 40.20 |
| 5        | 3         | 1            | 10       | 15       | 40.00 |
| 1        | 1         | 1            | 20       | 32       | 37.50 |
| 4        | 2         | 3            | 23.4     | 40       | 35.10 |

**Finding:**
- **Orders shown in decreasing order of average speed:**
> *While the fastest order only carried 1 pizza and the slowest order carried 3 pizzas, there is no clear trend that more pizzas slow down the delivery speed of an order.*  

### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  COUNT(pickup_time) as delivered,
  COUNT(order_id) AS total,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(pickup_time) / COUNT(order_id)) AS delivery_percent
FROM updated_runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

| runner_id | delivered | total | delivery_percent |
|-----------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| 1         | 4         | 4     | 100              |
| 2         | 3         | 4     | 75               |
| 3         | 1         | 2     | 50               |
